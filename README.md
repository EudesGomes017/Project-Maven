With Maven, you define the project in an XML file called pom.xml (Project Object Model). In this file, you specify the project settings, such as the required dependencies, the plugins to be used, and the construction tasks that must be performed.

Instead of manually handling project dependencies, Maven automatically resolves dependencies and downloads from remote repositories such as the Maven Central Repository.

In addition, Maven promotes a standardized directory structure for Java projects, making it easier to understand and maintain code.

In summary, Maven simplifies the process of building and managing Java projects by providing a more efficient and standardized way of working with dependencies and construction tasks.
